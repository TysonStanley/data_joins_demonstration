# Joining Data Sets

![](general_joining_graphic.jpg)

# Some Vocabulary

.pull-left[
.large[.large[
- .dcoral[**Join**] = combining two data sets (or *tables*) based on some **primary key(s)**
- .nicegreen[**Primary Key**] = a variable that uniquely identifies observations in a table
]]]

.footnote[

]

.pull-right[
.large[.large[
- .bluer[**Foreign Key**] = a variable that uniquely identifies an observation in another table
- .dcoral[**Relation**] = the relationship between a primary key and a foreign key (generally a 1-to-many relationship)

# Example

# Types of Joins

.pull-left[.large[.large[
.dcoral[**Inner Join**] = joining only the observations that are in both tables

.bluer[**Left Join**] = joining all observations in first table but drop those in the second that are not in the first
]]]

.pull-right[.large[.large[
.nicegreen[**Right Join**] = joining all observations in second table but drop those in the first that are not in the second

.dcoral[**Full (Outer) Join**] = joining all the observations whether they are in one or both tables
]]]

# Binding

.huge[
Sometimes we don't need to join, we need to .dcoral[**bind**]
]

---
# Review Questions

.huge[
1. Explain joining in a sentence or two.

2. If you have more individuals in data set 1 than data set 2 and you want to keep all of the observations, what kind of join is best?

3. Thought Experiment: What would happen if you tried to join on something other than your primary key (e.g., it is the primary key in one table but just a foreign key in another)?
]

---
# Answers

.huge[
1. Joining is taking two data sets and joining them based on identifiers (keys) or something like that.

2. Either left join or full join.

3. This situation is called duplicate keys. See next slide for an example.

# Duplicate Keys

.huge[For `x` this is a foreign key and for `y` it is a primary key. Why is that?]

1. Understand your data (both primary and foreign keys, missing values)

.huge[
Notes:

1. If .dcoral[key] (primary or foreign) is missing, those cannot be joined with the correct data (it will keep those in `full_join()`)

2. Other missing values are carried into the joined set
