# Quiz!

.huge[
- Explain joining in a sentence or two.
]

--

.huge[
- If you have more individuals in data set 1 than data set 2 and you want to keep all of the observations, what kind of join is best?
]

--

.huge[
- Thought Experiment: What would happen if you tried to join on a foreign key?
]

---
# Answers

.huge[
- Joining is taking two data sets and joining them based on identifiers (keys) or something similar to that.
]

--

.huge[
- Either left join or full join.
]

--

.huge[
- This situation is called duplicate keys. See next slide for an example.

# Duplicate Keys

.huge[For `x` this is a foreign key and for `y` it is a primary key. Why is that?]

# Health

load("data_officeparks/OfficeParks_Tables.rda")

health %>%
  DT::datatable(options = list(pageLength = 4, 
                               autoWidth = TRUE),
                rownames = FALSE)

# Demographics

```{r, echo=FALSE}
demo %>%
  DT::datatable(options = list(pageLength = 4),
                rownames = FALSE)

---
# Show Info

```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Joining in `R`

.huge[
We will use the .dcoral[`tidyverse`] package:
]

.large[.large[
1. .nicegreen[`inner_join`].dcoral[`(`]`data1, data2`.dcoral[`)`]

2. .nicegreen[`left_join`].dcoral[`(`]`data1, data2`.dcoral[`)`]

3. .nicegreen[`right_join`].dcoral[`(`]`data1, data2`.dcoral[`)`]

4. .nicegreen[`full_join`].dcoral[`(`]`data1, data2`.dcoral[`)`]

# Join Health and Demographics

.huge[
Notable aspects of these sets:
]

.large[.large[
- Health is in long form (two time points)

- Demographics and health have multiple overlapping primary keys (`nam` and `show`)
]]

---
# Join Health and Demographics

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
full_join(health, demo, by = c("nam", "show")) ## or inner_, left_,, or right_
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
full_join(health, demo, by = c("nam", "show")) %>%
  DT::datatable(options = list(pageLength = 4),
                rownames = FALSE)
```

---
# What if we .dcoral[forgot] one of the .nicegreen[keys]?

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
full_join(health, demo, by = "nam")
```

.large[.large[
This provides 80 rows (not the correct 76)
]]

--

<br>

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
full_join(health, demo, by = "show")
```

.large[.large[
This provides 1,480 rows (not the correct 76)

# .nicegreen[Unique] Identifiers

.huge[If we don't have unique identifiers the data can blow up]


---
# Common Errors...

.huge[
1. Understand your data (both primary and foreign keys, missing values)

2. Trying to join when should be "binding"
]

---
# What About Missing?

.huge[
Notes:

1. If .dcoral[key] (primary or foreign) is missing, those cannot be joined with the correct data (it will keep those in `full_join()`)

2. Other missing values are carried into the joined set
]

---
# .dcoral[Bind], Instead of Join

.huge[
What if we have two versions of the demographics table

- One that contains info on "Parks and Rec"
- The other on "The Office"

.bluer[Do we have keys we can join on?]
]

--

.huge[
Nope...
